# Interactive-Population-Map

This project is both a fun indie game and a data visualization of cities around the world. It simulates the typical geography quizzes you can find online, where you have to name the cities you know and they will show up marked on the map.

The program uses a dataset found online which is in a csv format, that has information on the top 5000 most populous cities of the world, or capitals if they don’t fit this criteria, and their coordinates and population. The java program then builds up its own data using object oriented programming by parsing the information on the csv file. 

To run the program, the user must input the relative path to the csv file as an argument, which should just be the name of the file if it's organized correctly in the folder.

The game has two stages, the one where you name the cities by typing in the console, then the cities will pop and an informational tab will show on the right, and the second stage is when you give up, you can type ‘Reveal All’ so all of the cities appear on the map. The size of each circle will be proportional to the population of the city, and they will have a red star if they are capital cities. Once this process is done, which you can tell as the stars will appear, then you can click on each circle so their information tab shows on the right, and that way you can also learn about the cities. As you go, there will be some statistics telling you how many cities and capitals you have named, and the aggregate population of these cities.

With this app, you will not only have fun but also learn about even more cities!
